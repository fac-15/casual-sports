## User journeys :information_desk_person: 

**Individual**: As a user, I want to be able to find sports teams and sports events that I can join.

**Team Leader**: As a user, I want to be able to add my team to the site, to see different opponents for my team, and to find new members for my team.

## User stories, Week 1 :full_moon_with_face: 

As a user, I can:

1. [ ] **Browse** through a **list** of sports events and sports teams.

2. [ ] **Filter** all events and teams by the **sport** I want to play.

3. [ ] **Select** a **specific** event or team, and get **more information** (such as location, which sports played, age range etc.)

4. [ ] Apply a **filter** that allows me to only see teams that are looking for **new members**, and events that are **open to all**.

5. [ ] **Register** my **team** on the site.

6. [ ] **Post** my **event** on the site.

## Current Stretch Goals :100: :grimacing: 

1. [ ] Use **login authentication** for users, team leaders and event admins.

2. [ ] Display search results on an **interactive map**!

3. [ ] Use the **Meetup.com API** and allow the user to also discover sports events on Meetup.
